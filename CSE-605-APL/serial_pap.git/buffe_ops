1.There will be two abstract entities which will be using the buffer one of them readers and other will be writers.
2. Reader Perspective:
    Though, there might be muliple readers involve with this design but all of them will share common traits. 
    So let's look at use cases from the perspective of reader.
    <USE CASE entity=reader type=buff_comm optional>
    	 The state of the buffer seen by a reader at any point of a time will be:
	<en>
	Reader has already read the whole buffer or just started reading.Therefore in both case it will be at the head of buffer.
	</en>
	<en>
	Reader has read some partial data. So the reader will try or trying to do something in the middle of the buffer.
	</en>
    </USE CASE>
    <USE CASE entity=reader type=buff_comm >
    	 <en>
	 Reader must wait unitl all the buffer has been filled and then filled buffer will be copied to reader's own buffer.
	 <Reason>
	 	 1.In our case we have only one reader therefore first copying one buffer to another is not gross inefficient.
		 2.As our incoming messages will be combination of some continuous bytes, so reader doesn't need to wait for
		 and check for all bytes discreetly to build the whole message. Our approach will  copy a defnite number of
		 bytes from source buffer and above them it can process. The length of the buffer will gurantee atleast one 
		 message.
	 </reason>
	 <cons>
		1.As many of times while reader is busying processing the message, there might be many time a spill over is
		happening at source side. Though it might not be a problem for us but we are loosing some messages.
	 </cons>	
	 </en>
    </USE CASE>

3.Implementation Detials:
<entity type= source>
	Our implementation of source thread which will collect the data from the IO source will be non-blocking. Means a reader will 
	register with the source through a mean of call backs and as the source buffer is filled, all callbacks will be called. Here,
	as a point of efficiency, we assume that registered call backs take small time to execute. It is also assumed that, while
	dispatching the call back, the source thread  will stop recieving more data. Actually this strategy is also make other tasks 
	a lot easier like if a registered entity doesn't want more message it can simply return from the call back.
</entity>

Threads:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Main Thread:
2.One thread will be listening to UART and copying the data to a shared message queue.:Hardware Thread.
3.One thread will construct the thread from this shared message queue and will put new constructed messages to some other caches.-Worker Thread.

Main Thread description:
-------------------------
1.Start: The main thread is application's main thread.
2.Responsibility:
a.The main thread will open the connection to UART. and will provide the serial connection pointer to both reader and writer. 
b.Main Thread also shares the Message Queues where reader and writer has to put their data.
3.Finish:
Main thread will finish when UART port is closed  due to some error or manually. Or after a particular timeout. Main thread will also
responsible for signalling other thread that data from the serial port has stopped so they must finish their execution.It will wait for 
other threads to finishand then exit safely.

Reader Thread Description:
-------------------------
1.Start: This thread will be started from the main thread. The reader thread will be given a valid pointer to serial port. And also access to
	 a shared queue where it needs to transmit the messages.
2.Processing:This thread is mainly responsible for getting the data from the serial port and after a MAXIMUM number of
bytes are received, these data is transferred to a fifo queue.And from this fifo queue these raw bytes are converted to some meaning full messages.
3.Finish:This thread will continue to read the data until the serial port is closed.

Processing Thread Description:
------------------------------
1.Start:Processing thread will started by the Main thread and provided a handle to queues of buffers from where	it will process the raw bytes and
make some menaingfull messages. These reconstucted messages will also need to be put in a shared queue for consumptions from the clients.
2.Finish:The main thread will signal this thread to exit and usually it will be when serial port is closed or some error occured.
