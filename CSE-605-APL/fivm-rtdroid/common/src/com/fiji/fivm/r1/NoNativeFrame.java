/** Annotation to ammend Import methods, indicating that a native frame should
    not be set up.  This makes the call a bit quicker, but has two adverse
    effects:
    <ol>
    <li>The runtime will not know how it ended up in native code, except by using
        stack tracing, which isn't currently implemented.</li>
    <li>Handles created by the native code will not be freed upon return from
        the given native method, but only from return of the next native method
	up on the stack (or when the thread dies if there isn't one).</li>
    </ol> */
