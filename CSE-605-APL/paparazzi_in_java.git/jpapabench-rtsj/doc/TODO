PapaBench RTSJ version
-----------------------

Concepts:
 - 2 main modules
   - modules allocated in immortal memory
 - modules threads
   - if allocate then allocate in local scope
 - passed data allocated in scope are copied on the base of primitive types
 
Refactoring:
 - papabench factory should be an object, not a class with static methods
 
    
Questions:
* It would be nice to have an opportunity to use handlers implementing Runnable in RealtimeThread as well as in SCJ periodic handlers.
 - just to have unified concept
 
 FIXME:
  - memory leak in logging
  - memory leak in creating radio message and inter-system message
  
TODO: summary of memory allocation, which module allocates memory? Why? Which type of memory is used?
